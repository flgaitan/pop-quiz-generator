# Title: Pop Quiz

## Description

The motivation for the project was to try to create a pop quiz with zero code given. Using the skills learned, dynamically adding elements through javaScript to the pop quiz.

This project was built to test the skills learned and attempt to the best of our abilities to succeed in this task. 

The problem this project is aimed to solve a practical skill. The quiz is not what is solving an issue at hand, but the quiz is the issue and instead in order to solve that we must succeed at creating it and making it work successfully. That is the best way to show how much we have learned and how well we can apply the skills being put to the test.

I have learned that javaScript is the brains of the operation. In order to succeed in making any page, any element, anything work - i must apply javaScript to it. For this particular task my biggest challenge is making everything work. I am having trouble telling the page how to read its commands, and adding everything else to that is a difficult task for me because of all its moving elemnets. It is not like other projects where we had to make one element work, this is literally adding all the moving elements to a page and making sure every single one of them is working. It is a lot, and its overwhelming to be quite frank. It's challenging and it brings out a lot of questions and road blocks, but in the end thses are the growing pains that one must go through in order to suceed. I hope that i can look back at this and smile at how hard this seemed when I am much further down the line.
